#### Scenario: Handle large time series
- **WHEN** a variable has more than 50,000 time points
- **THEN** the application SHALL downsample the data for initial display (e.g., every 10th point)
- **AND** provide a control to adjust the sampling rate or load full resolution

### Requirement: Data Table View
The application SHALL display variable data in a sortable and filterable table format.

#### Scenario: Display variable data in table
- **WHEN** the user switches to the table view
- **THEN** the application SHALL display all dimensions as columns (e.g., time, latitude, longitude, value)
- **AND** show at least the first 100 rows initially

#### Scenario: Sort table by column
- **WHEN** the user clicks a column header
- **THEN** the application SHALL sort the table by that column in ascending order
- **AND** toggle to descending order on subsequent clicks

#### Scenario: Filter table by value range
- **WHEN** the user enters a min/max value range for a column
- **THEN** the application SHALL filter rows to show only values within the range
- **AND** update the table immediately

#### Scenario: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **WHEN** the variable has more than 1,000 rows
- **THEN** the application SHALL use virtual scrolling to render only visible rows
- **AND** maintain smooth scrolling performance

### Requirement: Statistics Panel
The application SHALL compute and display statistical summaries of variable data.

#### Scenario: Display basic statistics
- **WHEN** a variable is selected
- **THEN** the application SHALL display minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation
- **AND** update statistics when filters are applied

#### Scenario: Handle missing values in statistics
- **WHEN** the variable data contains missing values (NaN or _FillValue)
- **THEN** the application SHALL exclude missing values from statistical calculations
- **AND** display the count of missing values separately

#### Scenario: Display data range percentiles
- **WHEN** the statistics panel is visible
- **THEN** the application SHALL display 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles
- **AND** update them in real-time as the user filters data

#### Scenario: Count total and filtered data points
- **WHEN** the user applies a filter
- **THEN** the statistics panel SHALL show both total data points and filtered data points
- **AND** display the percentage of data retained after filtering

### Requirement: Map View for Geospatial Data
The application SHALL visualize geospatial data on an interactive map when latitude and longitude coordinates are available.

#### Scenario: Enable map view for geospatial data
- **WHEN** the opened NetCDF file contains latitude and longitude dimensions
- **THEN** the application SHALL enable a "Map View" tab
- **AND** display a world map using a geographic projection (WGS84)

#### Scenario: Plot scalar field as heatmap
- **WHEN** the user selects a scalar variable (e.g., temperature, wave direction) in map view
- **THEN** the application SHALL render values as a heatmap overlay on the map
- **AND** use a color scale appropriate for the data range

#### Scenario: Interactive map navigation
- **WHEN** the user interacts with the map
- **THEN** the application SHALL support zoom (scroll wheel) and pan (click-drag)
- **AND** display zoom controls and a scale indicator

#### Scenario: Tooltip on map point hover
- **WHEN** the user hovers over a data point on the map
- **THEN** the application SHALL display a tooltip with latitude, longitude, and value
- **AND** highlight the hovered point

#### Scenario: Handle single-point geospatial data
- **WHEN** the NetCDF file has only a single lat/lon point (e.g., `fsru_mwd_2005-2009.nc`)
- **THEN** the application SHALL display a marker at that location
- **AND** center the map on the marker with an appropriate zoom level

### Requirement: Multi-Dimensional Data Handling
The application SHALL support visualization of multi-dimensional variables by allowing dimension slicing.

#### Scenario: Slice 3D variable to 2D
- **WHEN** a variable has three dimensions (e.g., time, latitude, longitude)
- **THEN** the application SHALL provide controls to select a fixed value for one dimension
- **AND** visualize the resulting 2D slice (e.g., map at a specific time)

#### Scenario: Animate over a dimension
- **WHEN** the user enables animation mode for a dimension (e.g., time)
- **THEN** the application SHALL sequentially display slices and update the visualization
- **AND** provide play/pause and speed controls

#### Scenario: Handle higher-dimensional data (4D+)
- **WHEN** a variable has four or more dimensions
- **THEN** the application SHALL allow the user to fix values for all but two dimensions
- **AND** visualize the resulting 2D projection

### Requirement: Responsive Layout
The application SHALL provide a responsive layout that adapts to different window sizes.

#### Scenario: Resize window maintains usability
- **WHEN** the user resizes the application window
- **THEN** UI components SHALL adjust proportionally
- **AND** charts, tables, and panels SHALL remain readable and functional

#### Scenario: Sidebar collapse
- **WHEN** the window width is reduced below 1024 pixels
- **THEN** the metadata sidebar SHALL collapse into a toggleable drawer
- **AND** the main visualization area SHALL expand to use the available space

#### Scenario: Minimum window size
- **WHEN** the window is resized below 800x600 pixels
- **THEN** the application SHALL enforce a minimum window size
- **AND** display a message suggesting increasing the window size for optimal viewing

### Requirement: Chart Customization
The application SHALL allow users to customize chart appearance and behavior.

#### Scenario: Change chart type
- **WHEN** the user selects a different chart type (line, scatter, bar)
- **THEN** the application SHALL re-render the data using the selected chart type
- **AND** preserve zoom/pan state if applicable

#### Scenario: Customize axis labels
- **WHEN** the user edits axis labels
- **THEN** the application SHALL update the chart with custom labels
- **AND** retain the default labels as a reset option

#### Scenario: Toggle grid lines
- **WHEN** the user toggles grid lines on/off
- **THEN** the chart SHALL show or hide grid lines accordingly
- **AND** remember the preference for subsequent charts

#### Scenario: Export chart as image
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Export Chart"
- **THEN** the application SHALL save the current chart as a PNG image
- **AND** use a file picker to let the user choose the save location
